<h1> Polymwk-rs</h1>
Insider Intelligence & Whale Forensics for Polymarket
</div>
<br><br>
<hr>

This is a polyfill-rs Fork. 
Why polymwk-rs?
While the original poly-fill-rs provides excellent foundational access to the Polymarket ecosystem, polymwk-rs (Polymarket Whale & Knowledge) is engineered specifically for analysts and developers who need to look beneath the surface of simple trades.

 -Whale Forensics: Built-in logic to track large-volume movements and identify "smart money" patterns before they hit the mainstream.

 -Insider Intelligence: Specialized filters to detect suspicious betting patterns or coordinated wallet activity that might indicate non-public information.

 -Optimized for Speed: Inherits the high-performance Rust core but adds asynchronous streams specifically tuned for low-latency market monitoring.

 Enhanced Metadata: We don't just return transaction hashes; we provide enriched data structures that help you understand the intent behind the trade.

Key Features
Real-time Orderbook Analysis: Native support for monitoring depth changes on high-stakes markets.

Historical Reconnaissance: Tools to scrape and analyze past whale behavior for backtesting predictive models.

Automated Alerts: Easily configurable hooks for specific wallet addresses or volume thresholds.
