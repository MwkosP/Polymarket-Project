# 🐋 Polymarket Intelligence Suite (polyfill-rs Fork)

A high-performance intelligence layer built on a specialized fork of **polyfill-rs**. This project extends the core library to provide advanced wallet forensics, insider detection, and real-time whale-tracking capabilities.

> **Why this fork?** This version extends `polyfill-rs` v0.2.3 to bridge the gap between high-frequency trading and deep-dive market intelligence. It is optimized for speed, decoding market data ~21% faster than standard clients.
